# 📋 Trackly

This is the **frontend** application for **Trackly**: a collaborative organization and task-tracking app built for couples, families, and friend groups who want an easy way to stay on top of shared responsibilities, to-dos, and expenses — all in one place.

## 🚀 Motivation

Managing everyday tasks and shared responsibilities often involves juggling multiple apps — one for to-do lists, another for expenses, and so on. **Trackly** was created to simplify this experience by combining the best features of several productivity tools into a single, user-friendly app designed for households and small groups.

The goal is to provide a solid, scalable platform for personal and shared productivity — with future versions expanding into collaborative features such as shared lists, group task assignments, and expense tracking.
